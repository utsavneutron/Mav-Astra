## In Sanskrit, “Astra” means weapon. 

Mav Astra has the following features:

1.	Login and registration: Login and registration is required to use all the features of the app. Valid email and password is required for login/registration.
2.	UTA Calendar: Mavericks would not need to check canvas to check the assignment due dates when they use MAV Astra. It would integrate with canvas calendar and set reminders for all the assignments due dates.
3.	UTA Pay: Mav Astra could be a great tool to pay for UTA services. It can be used to pay for UTA parking, cafeteria, vending machines and many more.
4.	UTA Health: Making appointment at UTA Health center will be even easier with MAV Astra, with additional features like saving and updating health transcripts, and reviewing and analyzing health to know the current health status.
5.	UTA Fit: We want UTA Mavericks to stay fit and healthy. Our app would change the daily eating habits, because it would calculate the calorie intake of the students and show the updated BMI.
6.	UTAQ: Mav Astra could be a fun app too. It has updated quiz games which allows students to give their responses and view scores.
7.	SEVA: “Seva” is a Sanskrit word whose English translation is service. It allows students to involve in some volunteering works. It also helps to find blood when needed as well as allows to do blood donation by finding nearby blood donation camps.
8.	UTA SOS: Students can be in emergency situations at any time. This app will notify the closed one, listed in the emergency contact, and also calls 911 in a very efficient manner.
